# [JLPT N4 Vocabulary Screensaver](https://deanspooner.github.io/anki-screensaver) by [Dean Spooner](https://google.com)

A simple screensaver app to display Anki flashcards of [JLPT N4 vocabulary](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/836825730), [JLPT N4 kanji](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/431671556) and [JLPT N4 grammar](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/688686581). A new line of the card is revealed every 3 seconds - tap/click anywhere on the screen to pause/unpause the timer, if you want to spend longer looking at the card. 3 seconds after the last part of the card is revealed, a new card will be randomly selected.
